        <p>On this webpage, we  will cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article will explain what HTML is and cover the basic elements of a HTML document and all the important terms. It will also explains where these fit into HTML documents. You will also learn about void elements and how to add images. We will close this by teaching you about nesting elements and how to create hyperlinks.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_HTML?">
        <header>What is HTML?</header>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit, it is not a programming language. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different. Let's look into the following example to get a better idea of what HTML is like:</p>
        <section class="maincode"><code>My cat is very grumpy</code></section>
        <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (<code class="pcode">&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:</p>
        <section class="maincode"><code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code></section>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <p>Let's dive deeper and explore the anatomy of our previous example :<p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png">
        <p>The three main part of our elements are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.This tag identify the begining of our element.  In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
          <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
          <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This marks where the element ends it is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. Don't forget to include a closing tag, it is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results. </li>
        <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by the content, followed by the closing tag.</>
      </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
        <header>Nesting elements</header>
        <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code class="pcode">&lt;strong&gt</code> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
        <section class="maincode"><code>&lt;p&gtMy cat is &lt;strong&gtvery&lt;/strong&gt grumpy.&lt;/p&gt </section>
        </code>
        <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <code class="pcode">p</code> element first, then opened the <code class="pcode">strong</code> element. For proper nesting, we should close the <code class="pcode">strong</code> element first, before closing the <code class="pcode">p</code>.</p>
      </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Void_elements">
        <header>Void elements</header>
        <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements. For example, the <code class="pcode">&lt;img&gt</code> element embeds an image file onto a page:</p>
         <section class="maincode"><code>&lt;img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ME5njFykN9GFW71Hu6nAxAHaCb&pid=Api&P=0&h=180"&gt alt="freeCodeCamp Logo"</code> </section>
        <p>This would output the following:</p>
        <section class="imgcode"><code><img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ME5njFykN9GFW71Hu6nAxAHaCb&pid=Api&P=0&h=180"><code></section>
      </section> 
      <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header>Attributes</header>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt"Example of adding a class attribute to a p element">
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the <code class="pcode">class</code> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
        <p>An attribute should have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
          <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
        </ul>  
      </section>

        <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
        <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
        <section class="multi_line_code">
        <code >
          <p>&lt;!doctype html&gt</p>
          <p>&lt;html lang="en-US&gt</p>
          <p class="index1">&lt;head&gt</p>
          <p class="index2">&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt</p>
          <p class="index2">&lt;title&gtMy test page&lt;/title&gt</p>
          <p class="index1">&lt;/head&gt</p>
          <p class="index1">&lt;body&gt</p>
          <p class="index2">&lt;p&gtThis is my page&lt;/p&gt</p>
          <p class="index1">&lt;/body&gt</p>
          <p>&lt;/html&gt</p>
        </code>
        </section>
        <p>Here we have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype.</li>
          <li>&lt;html&gt&lt;/html&gt: The &lt;html&gt element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
          <li>&lt;head&gt&lt;/head&gt: The &lt;head&gt element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.</li>
          <li>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt: The &lt;meta&gt element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like &lt;base&gt, &lt;link&gt, &lt;script&gt, &lt;style&gt or &lt;title&gt. The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for your document as UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</li>
          <li>&lt;title&gt&lt;/title&gt: The &lt;title&gt element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
          <li>&lt;body&gt&lt;/body&gt: The &lt;body&gt element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
        <header>HTML comments</header>
        <p>HTML comments are used in order to leave notes in your code, they don't get displayed in your broswer.This means that any comments you add to your HTML source code will not be shown when the document gets rendered in a web browser. Writing comments is helpful and it's a good practice to follow when writing source code. Comments help you document and communicate about your code and thought process to yourself (and others). It also reminds you what you were thinking/doing when you come back to a project after months of not working on it.Comments also help you communicate with other developers who are working on the project with you. Your comments can clearly explain to them why you added certain lines of code.</p>
        <p>Comments in HTML start with <code class="pcode">&lt;!--</code> and end with <code class="pcode">--&gt</code>. The general syntax for an HTML comment looks like this:</p>
        <section class="maincode"><code>&lt;!-- I am a comment! --&gt</code> </section>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
        <header>Summary</header>
        <p>You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of the basics of HTML.</p>
        <p>At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level. You should also be able to write a few elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go further on some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting other concepts of the language.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As you start to learn more about HTML, consider learning the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is the language used to style web pages, such as changing fonts or colors or altering the page layout. HTML and CSS work well together, as you will soon discover.</li>
